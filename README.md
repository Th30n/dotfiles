# Linux config files

This is just a bunch of dot config files I use on my Linux boxes.
If some particular configuration grows too big I'll split it into
separate repository.

## Installation

In order to install follow these steps:

  * `git clone https://github.com/Th30n/dotfiles.git dotfiles`
  * Change directory to repository root `cd dotfiles`
  * This will **delete** and replace your configuration with those from
    the repository: `bash link-em-up`
